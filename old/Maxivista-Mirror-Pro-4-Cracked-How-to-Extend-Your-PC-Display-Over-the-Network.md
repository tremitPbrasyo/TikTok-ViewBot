## Step 4: Troubleshoot Maxivista Mirror Pro 4
 
Although Maxivista Mirror Pro 4 is compatible with standard graphics drivers for Windows Vista and Windows 7, there are still some issues that you might encounter while using it. Here are some common problems and solutions:

- If you see a black screen on your secondary PC, make sure that the firewall on both PCs allows Maxivista to communicate. You can also try to disable the firewall temporarily and see if it works.
- If you experience lag or stuttering on your extended display, make sure that your network connection is stable and fast enough. You can also try to lower the resolution or quality of the extended display using the display settings.
- If you cannot play video on your extended display using Windows Media Player 12, you need to disable the hardware acceleration feature of the player. To do this, open Windows Media Player 12, click on Tools > Options > Performance, and uncheck the box that says "Turn on DirectX Video Acceleration for WMV files".
- If you cannot use Aero effects on your primary PC while Maxivista is running, you need to enable the Aero theme on your secondary PC. To do this, right-click on the desktop of your secondary PC, click on Personalize, and select one of the Aero themes.
